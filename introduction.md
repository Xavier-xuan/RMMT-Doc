# Introduction

## What is Roommate Matcher?


Roommate Matcher is a questionnaire-based roommate matching program designed to pair individuals based on their compatibility in living preferences and lifestyle choices. By gathering information through a set of targeted questions, the system analyzes key factors such as cleanliness habits, sleep schedules, social preferences, and study environments. Using a weighted algorithm, Roommate Matcher ranks potential roommates based on similarity scores, providing users with the best possible match to ensure a harmonious living experience. This tool has been adopted by Zhixin Residential College at the Southern University of Science and Technology, serving more than 600 freshmen.


## Architecture

**Roommate Matcher** is structured into three main modules: `API Server (Backend)`, `Student Frontend`, and `Admin Frontend`.

- **API Server (Backend):** This module handles all backend operations, data processing, and interfacing with the database. Access the repository at [RMMT-API](https://github.com/Xavier-xuan/RMMT-API).

- **Student Frontend:** A user interface where students can fill out the questionnaire and view their matches. Visit the repository at [RMMT-Student](https://github.com/Xavier-xuan/RMMT-Student).

- **Admin Frontend:** This interface allows administrators to manage questionnaires, student data, and match configurations. Check out the repository at [RMMT-Admin](https://github.com/Xavier-xuan/RMMT-Admin).

We welcome contributions from all! Feel free to explore our repositories and contribute to the development of Roommate Matcher.
