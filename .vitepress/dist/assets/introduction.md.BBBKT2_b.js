By gathering information through a set of targeted questions, the system analyzes key factors such as cleanliness habits, sleep schedules, social preferences, and study environments. Using a weighted algorithm, Roommate Matcher ranks potential roommates based on similarity scores, providing users with the best possible match to ensure a harmonious living experience. This tool has been adopted by Zhixin Residential College at the Southern University of Science and Technology, serving more than 600 freshmen.</p><h2 id="architecture" tabindex="-1">Architecture <a class="header-anchor" href="#architecture" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Architecture&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Roommate Matcher</strong> is structured into three main modules: <code>API Server (Backend)</code>, <code>Student Frontend</code>, and <code>Admin Frontend</code>.</p><ul><li><p><strong>API Server (Backend):</strong> This module handles all backend operations, data processing, and interfacing with the database.
